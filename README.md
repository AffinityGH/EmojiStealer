## Usage

You can find a guide on how to use the plugin below.

You can get the URL by right click on any emoji and selecting **Copy Emoji URL**.

### Using the Emoji

You can use an emoji by either using:
- `e$ <emojiname>`
- `es$ <emojiname>`

Where **e$** gets the larger 64x64 image vs. **es$** which gets the smaller 32x32 version.

## Questions?

Leave them in the issues section of this GitHub. I hope to streamline how emojis are stolen in the future but this is the best I could do at 4 AM.
